# Eisenhower matrix website

**Author : *Badr YOUBI IDRISSI***

This is a website that implements the eisenhower matrix method of organising priorities.

It utilises ReactJS as a front end engine and NodeJS.

For the state management : Redux will be used

The basic idea is that all tasks can be classified as Important/Not Important and Urgent/ Not urgent. And depending on which category the task falls into, we do it more or less quickcly. 

With this website I wish to go further than this basic premise. I want to implement different dimensions of importance : indeed, there is no single notion of "importance". A task can be important on a professional viewpoint and less important on a personal level. 

I also wish to implement an automatic evolution of the tasks as a function of time. Indeed seeing the different tasks become urgent pushes us to action.

This is a personal project meant to improve my web devevlopment skills.
